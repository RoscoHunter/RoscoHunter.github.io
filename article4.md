<h1>The Bostrom Buckle: Visualising the Vulnerable World Hypothesis</h1>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Motivation.</b><br>
The mantra of Silicon Valley is to “move fast and break things”, with the assumption being that these breaks can be mended post-hoc. However, Nick Bostrom’s vulnerable world hypothesis (VWH) [1] presents a sobering alternative: There exist certain advanced technologies whose discovery would break society to a point of devastation. The VWH suggests that averting this devastation requires extreme societal changes, possibly even an all-encompassing surveillance state. But, how would we identify vulnerabilities and are there less drastic means to avert catastrophe? This article employs the concept of buckling to help visualise the VWH, thereby assisting policymakers in addressing these crucial questions. Before delving into the details, let’s explore a more mundane example of buckling.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Introducing Buckling.</b><br>
Picture yourself holding a standard plastic ruler between your hands [2] and applying some level of force to either end. For small forces, the ruler appears resilient as its straight form remains stable (A). In this low-force regime, a small perturbation to the ruler’s curvature is quickly resolved as the ruler snaps back into shape. However, there is a critical threshold at which the force becomes sufficient to provoke a dramatic change. At this point, the ruler succumbs to instability and buckles either downwards (B) or upwards (C). This illustrates how buckling can flip formerly stable states (a straight ruler) into instability while establishing new stable states (a curved ruler) that were previously unstable. Mathematicians would depict this in the diagram below.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Buckling as a model of the VWH.</b><br>
Using the framework of buckling, we condense the VWH into a simplified dynamical model of state power for various levels of technological progress. Here, the term “state power’’ is defined as the ability of the state to prevent and mitigate existential threats to its stability. The model shown in the diagram below suggests that in societies with modest technological progress, there exists a relatively stable level of state power that sits in a semi-anarchic (green) region. This semi-anarchic region represents a Goldilocks zone between absolute tyranny, where a collapse of the existing order seems implausible, and absolute anarchy, where a return to order appears equally improbable. But why should this stable level of state power emerge in the context of modest technological advancement?<br>

</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">In the modest-technology regime, the state’s inability to tightly control the thoughts and actions of non-state actors limits its power. Given enough time, a state that has drifted towards tyranny will eventually ‘snap back into shape’ as a revolt upends the state order. On the other side, non-state actors generally lack the insight, organisation, and resources to easily diminish state power. This prevents terrorists and adversaries from threatening its existence on a daily basis, averting an overwhelming sense of anarchy. Even in cases where a state drifts towards anarchy, it is common for a strongman leader to eventually emerge and reinstate a diminished sense of state power. The stability described above mirrors how small deviations of the ruler’s curvature in the low-force regime swiftly self-correct.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Crossing the Threshold.</b><br>
However, this stability extends only up to a certain technological threshold. What would the world look like upon crossing this threshold? Without a strong commitment to establishing global governance, it could descend into a geopolitical race for dominance. Advanced technologies would grant governments around the globe an unprecedented level of destructive power. As such, heads of state might perceive foreign entities with advanced technology as intolerable threats to their nations. This would compel them to subdue smaller powers and dethrone larger ones, gradually bringing more of the world under their control.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">Within their borders, some governments would shift toward tyranny [3], imposing mass-surveillance and a push for cultural homogeneity. Countries opposing this authoritarian shift, protecting privacy and individual freedoms, could descend into a state of anarchy. In the absence of surveillance*, increasingly sophisticated terrorist organisations could thrive, endangering the security of the state. In the absence of cultural homogeneity, advanced digital technologies like social media could fuel polarisation, fracturing pluralist nations. While we’ve refrained from directly speculating on the truth of the VWH, the description above resonates alarmingly [4,5] with present-day realities. Nonetheless, amidst these concerns, there remains a case for hope.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Policies.</b><br>
Even if the buckling model proves accurate and our world has crossed the threshold, we can leverage this knowledge to avert the bleakest of futures. Unlike the ruler, which is purely bound by deterministic forces, our civilization has the capacity to push against the forces moving it toward undesirable futures. Thankfully, researchers are already working to understand how vulnerabilities can be prevented and mitigated. For example, Anderljung and Hazell [6] describe a ‘Misuse Chain’ that can aid policymakers in dealing with novel threats such as AI-assisted toxin synthesis. However, there is certainly more work to be done, and hopefully this article can add to these efforts.<br>
  
<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Conclusion.</b><br>
While the “Bostrom Buckle” may not encapsulate the entirety of the VWH**, it provides a tangible means to visualize such an overbearing existential problem. Whether the VWH holds true or not, the need to safeguard our civilization against the pitfalls of advanced technology remains critical. Only through a concerted effort to anticipate and address these vulnerabilities can we hope to prevent our world from buckling under the weight of its own progress.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>*Footnote:</b>
Moreover, the gains in predictive capacity created by mass surveillance may make ‘private societies’ economically uncompetitive.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>**Footnote:</b>
The model doesn’t incorporate differential technological development. Furthermore, although it can easily incorporate Type 1, Type 2-a, and Type-2b vulnerabilities, it is not well suited to Type-0 vulnerabilities.<br>
