<p style="font-size: 18px;">I am a PhD candidate at the University of Warwick, supervised by Dr. Hongkai Wen. I'm also a member of the Warwick AI-Systems Lab, which works closely with the Embedded AI team at SAIC (Samsung AI Cambridge).</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">My research interests include:</p>  
<ul>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Neural Architecture Search (and AutoML more broadly)</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Robust, Interpretable, and Efficent Architecture Design</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Foundation Models</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Governance and Political Theory of AI</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Computational Neuroscience</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">In 2023, I received [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-skTMWiZS0">Best Paper</a>] at the International Conference of Automated Machine Learning. Previously, I received a First Class (85%) BSc in Mathematics from the University of Warwick, achieving a first in all 25 assessed modules. My overarching interests are in understanding and producing intelligent systems that can be harnessed for the benefit of humanity.</p>
