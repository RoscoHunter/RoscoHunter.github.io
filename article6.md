<h1>A Non-Technical Introduction to AI</h1>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Introduction.</b><br>
To understand Artificial Intelligence (AI), we must first recognise the factors that make humans intelligent. When we are born, our brains have almost no knowledge about the world around us. As our brains develop, we gradually build an increasingly complex internal model of the external world. This model allows us to recognize patterns, reason, and ultimately exhibit intelligent behaviour. But how exactly does our brain construct this model? <br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">The leading theory suggests that our brain continuously tries to predict the next sensory input that it will see, hear, smell, taste, or feel. Our brain rewards itself for correct predictions and adjusts itself for incorrect ones. This process incentivizes the brain to recognize patterns in the world around it. For example, if I hear a barking sound, my likelihood of seeing a dog increases. If I learn to recognise this pattern, then I can correctly predict that a dog may be nearby upon hearing a bark. By recognising billions of these patterns, our brain builds an increasingly sophisticated model of the external world.  <br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">AI works in a similar way. An AI system is a computer program that consumes vast quantities of data in order to learn an internal model of the external world. AI systems are trained to predict the next piece of data that they will receive, being rewarded for correct predictions and adjusted for incorrect ones. As an AI system can process data much quicker than a human, they rapidly develop an understanding of the world which accounts for subtle patterns that humans are unable to notice. This has a number of practical applications, three of which are listed below. <br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Application 1 - Cancer Diagnosis:</b><br>
Medical scans visually represent the interior of a patientâ€™s body, which can help doctors to determine whether or not a patient has cancer. By showing an AI system thousands of medical scans, it can learn to recognise subtle patterns that only appear in the cancerous scans. As such, AI systems can help radiologists to make more accurate diagnoses by highlighting signs of cancer that a human might struggle to notice.<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Application 2 - Drug Discovery:</b><br>
If scientists completely understood the human body, they would be able to design a drug to treat many more illnesses. However, the human body is unimaginably complex, making it hard to identify and design effective drugs. Even proteins (the building blocks of cells) behave in ways that scientists struggle to predict. By showing an AI model thousands of examples of proteins, it can learn to recognise the subtle patterns that govern their behaviour. The AI model can then use this knowledge to design new medicines, which humans might have struggled to discover. The animation below shows the creative process of an AI system imagining a new protein. It starts with a soup of disconnected amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and gradually designs a protein that can bind to the target (pink) molecule. <br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Application 3 - Writing Poetry:</b><br>
AI can even learn to do more creative jobs, such as writing poetry. If an AI reads large amounts of poetry, it can learn the patterns that underpin human emotions, culture, and creativity. For example, I asked an AI to write a short poem about a Welsh Seaside Village (Abersoch) - in a few seconds it wrote this. <br>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
In Abersoch, the salty breeze, <br>
Carries laughter, sets souls at ease. <br>
Seaside bliss, where worries fade, <br>
Sun-kissed smiles, memories made. <br>
