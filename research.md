<h1>Neuroscience Project</h1>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">Worked under the supervision of Prof. Edmund Rolls of the Oxford Centre of Computational Neuroscience measuring effective connectivity in the human connectome. Connectivity matrices were derived from a `Hopf Algorithm' composed of noisy coupled oscillators which modelled the 360 cortical regions in the HCP multimodal parcellation atlas.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">The Hopf algorithm has since been used to study the connectivity of brain areas ranging from the hippocampus to the anterior cingulate cortex. These areas are important for understanding memory formation and depression, respectively.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 14px;">Contributions to the explanation and implementation of the Hopf algorithm led to acknowledgments in a series of papers: Four papers published in Cerebral Cortex; one paper in Neuroimage; and one paper in Human Brain Mapping:</p>
