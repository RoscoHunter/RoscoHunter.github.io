<p style="font-size: 18px;">I am a PhD candidate at the University of Warwick, focusing on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), supervised by Dr Hongkai Wen. I'm also a member of the Warwick AI-Systems Lab, which works closely with the Embedded AI team at SAIC (Samsing AI Cambridge). My research interests include:</p>  
<ul>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Neural Architecture Search (and AutoML more broadly)</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Robust and Efficent Architecture Design</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Foundation Models</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Computational Neuroscience</p></li>
    <li><p style="font-size: 18px; "margin-bottom: 0;">Political Theory of Artificial Intelligence</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Received "Best Paper" at the Internation Conference of Automated Machine Learning 2023. Previously, I received a First Class (85%) BSc in Mathematics from the University of Warwick, achieving a first in all 25 assessed modules. My overarching interests are in understanding and producing intelligent systems that can be harnessed for the good of humanity.</p>
